# Project Name - Lending Club Case Study


## Project Overview
This organization is a leading online platform for loans, offering services for personal loans, business loans, and financing for medical treatments. It provides borrowers with a quick and user-friendly online interface to secure loans at competitive interest rates.

Like other lending institutions, a significant challenge is the financial losses caused by lending to high-risk borrowers, referred to as credit loss. Credit loss occurs when a borrower fails to repay their loan or absconds with the borrowed amount. In this context, borrowers classified as "charged-off" are those who have defaulted, contributing substantially to the lender's financial losses.


## Problem Statement
A consumer finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. While getting the loan application, 2 types of risks are associated to approve the loan.
1. If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
2. If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company.

We need to find out the patterns of borrowers of getting defaulted based on their past loan history.
